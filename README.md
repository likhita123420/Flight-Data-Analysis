# Flight Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on flight-related data to uncover insights into patterns and trends in air travel.

The analysis explores areas like flight delays, airlines performance, seasonal trends, time-based patterns, and more — helping understand key factors that impact flight operations and passenger experiences.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset contains flight data with features such as:
  - **Flight Date/Time**
  - **Origin & Destination**
  - **Airline**
  - **Delay times**
  - **Distance**
  - **Other flight characteristics**
- This dataset provides a rich source for exploring travel behavior and operational trends in the airline industry.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading**
   - Import and inspect flight dataset
2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values and inconsistencies
   - Format date/time
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Check basic statistics of flight features
   - Visualize distribution of delays
   - Analyze relationships between airlines and delay patterns
   - Time-based trends (monthly/seasonal variations)
   - Origin/destination influence on flight performance
4. **Visualization**
   - Bar plots
   - Histograms
   - Scatter plots
   - Time series analysis

## 📊 Key Insights
The analysis helps answer insights such as:
- Which airlines experience the most delays?
- How do delays vary by month or season?
- Is distance correlated with flight delays?
- What are common delay causes?

These insights are useful for stakeholders like airline operations analysts, passengers, and data enthusiasts.

## 📈 Visualizations
The project includes meaningful visualizations like:
- Delay distributions
- Airline comparisons
- Monthly/seasonal flight patterns
- Heatmaps and trend charts

These visuals make it easier to interpret patterns and summarize findings.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/likhita123420/Flight-Data-Analysis.git
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook
Run all cells sequentially to view the analysis

🧪 Sample Observations
- Flight delays peak during certain months of the year.
- Some airlines show consistently lower delay averages.
- Longer flights may not necessarily mean more delays.
📌 Conclusion
